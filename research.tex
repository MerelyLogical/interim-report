\section{Background Research}
% The background section must outline the necessary background to the project,
% stating how it is important for the project work. For example: survey of related
% literature, analysis of competing products, technical specifications of hardware
% or software standards, electronic components, necessary software tools,
% background theory. The contents of this section will vary for different
% projects, and in many cases the background reading will have been completed –
% but if not you should be in a position to list what remains to be done (e.g. a
% set of research papers to read and understand). A good benchmark of progress
% here is that you have accumulated (though may not yet have read) at least 20
% references to background material. In projects which have substantial background
% writing up your literature survey in the Interim Report will save time at the
% end of the project and allow this element of your final report to receive timely
% feedback from your supervisor so the final write-up can be improved.

\subsection{Online Arithmetic}
Traditional arithmetic operators have two common characteristics.
Firstly, their order of operation may be different depending on the operation
itself.
A traditional adder, parallel or serial, generates its answers from the LSD to
the MSD.
A traditional divider design, on the other hand, generates its answer from
the MSD to the LSD~\cite{Brent1}\cite{Srinivas1}.

Due to this inconsistency, arithmetic operators may be forced to compute
word-by-word, waiting for all digits to finish in the previous operator before
the next can start~\cite{Zhao1}.
Therefore, if a divider follows an adder, the divider has to wait until the
adder has completed its computation before it can begin its own.

The other commonality of traditional designs is that their precisions are
specified at design-time.
Once built, a 32-bit adder always adds 32 bits together, adding 16-bit numbers
usually involves masking the unused bits.
A possible way of making it less inefficient would be using SIMD
instructions~\cite{Duncan1}, splitting a large register into a few smaller ones,
to execute the same instruction on them in parallel.
This, however, has the tradeoff of being harder to program, and the applications
must have sufficient parallelism to exploit.

Online arithmetic does not suffer from the first issue as it performs all
arithmetic operations from MSD first~\cite{Ercegovac1}~\cite{Ercegovac2}.
Furthermore, pipelining can be used with online serial arithmetic operators.
Thus the output digit of an earlier operation can be fed into the next
operator before the earlier one completes its computation.

\begin{figure}[H]

           operators~\cite{Ercegovac1}}
  \label{Online}
\end{figure}

As illustrated in figure~\ref{Online}, while each individual operation may
take longer than its conventional counterpart, online arithmetic can provide
a speedup if the operators are chained in serial.
In addition to the tradeoff in time, individual online arithmetic operators
also uses more memory.
To perform all computation from the MSD to the LSD, the use of a
redundant number system is compulsory.
However, this redundancy also has its advantage in making the operators
scalable.
The time required per digit can be made independent of the length of the
operands~\cite{Trivedi1}.

A recently proposed architecture allows the precision of
online arithmetic to be controlled at runtime~\cite{Zhao1}.
Traditionally, this runtime control was restricted due to the parallel adders
present in the multipliers and dividers.
This architecture reuses a fixed-precision adder and stores residues in
on-chip RAM.
As such, a single piece of hardware can be used to calculate to any precision,
limited only by the size of the on-chip RAM.

The way online arithmetic alleviates the second problem of fixed precision
falls out directly from its MSD-first nature.
Suppose the output of a conventional ripple adder is sampled before
it has completed its operation.
In this case, the lower digits would have been completed, but the carry would
not have reached the higher ones.
This means the error on the result would be significant, as the top bits
were still undetermined~\cite{Shi1}.
However, if the output of a parallel online adder is sampled before its
completion, the lower bits would be the undetermined ones.
This means the error of the operation would be small.
With overclocking, online arithmetic operators fail gracefully, losing their
precision gradually from the lowest bits first.
Thus, it allows for a runtime tradeoff between precision and
frequency~\cite{Shi2}.

\subsection{High-radix Arithmetic}
Conventional designs of arithmetic operators use binary representations.
The additional concerns of high-radix operators did not provide justifiable
improvements as clock speed of processors kept increasing.
In recent years, the clock speed increase effectively ended, and semiconductor
dies shrunk to extremely small sizes.
This means the relative processing time available in a clock period increased.
This enabled and drove the desire for accomplishing more per clock cycle, and
high-radix arithmetic is one of them.
It has been shown that, high-radix offers power saving and/or reasonable
speedups to the arithmetic operations~\cite{Catanzaro1}\cite{Amin1}\cite{Chen1}.

However, the savings are not without trade-offs.
If the radix chosen is not a power of 2, then this trade-off can become
unfavourable if the specification requires much I/O
and little computation.
This is because overhead of radix conversion would be significant~\cite{Whyte1}.
It is also unwise to use high-radix representations when the numbers are
unusually small, thus making the savings offered by the high-radices
negligible~\cite{Catanzaro1}.
The radix also cannot be too high, as the time in a clock period is still
limited, if there is too many logic gates for the signal to propagate through,
it might become the critical path and slow down the overall design.

The construct of FPGAs might make high-radices more attractive than it is on
ICs.
As FPGAs contain small fast carry-ripple adders, high-radix adders may be able
to exploit them to obtain significant speedups~\cite{Kornerup1}.

\subsection{High-radix Online Arithmetic}
Using high-radix number representations for online arithmetic is a
relatively novel concept.
While there has been some research with similar
premises~\cite{Lynch1}\cite{Lynch2},
We take a more direct approach with this project by implementing custom
operators made for high-radix online arithmetic on an FPGA.
This will provide empirical results on the method, and will hopefully reveal
practical insights along the way.

Furthermore, benchmarking this exotic arithmetic system with popular FPGA
applications such as neural networks would be interesting, as there is not
much precedence for it.
